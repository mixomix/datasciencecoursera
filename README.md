# datasciencecoursera
This repository contains solution to the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project" 

There are two main things in here:
* run_analysis.R - script that is the solution for tidying the data.
* CodeBook.md - description of columns and values in them

run_analysis.R
--------------
The script merges available data by requirements given, then it attaches names to columns, 
drops unneccessary columns , joins available data labels and then calculates averages (+ stores output).

Final output for taks 4 (in coursera course) is stored into data set final_data1.
Final output for taks 5 (in coursera course) is stored into data set final_data2.
